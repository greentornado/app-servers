## Scope
The idea behind this repository is to benchmark different languages implementation of HTTP server.

### Hello World
The *application* i tested is minimal: the HTTP version of the *Hello World* example.  
This approach allows including languages i barely know, since it is pretty easy to find such implementation online.  
If you're looking for more complex examples, you will have better luck with the [TechEmpower benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/).

### Disclaimer
Please do take the following numbers with a grain of salt: it is not my intention to promote one language over another basing on micro-benchmarks.  
Indeed you should never pick a language just basing on its presumed performance.

## Languages
I have filtered the languages by single runtime (i.e. Java on JVM): this way i can focus on a specific stack, keeping it updated to the last available version/APIs. 
Where possible i just relied on the standard library, but when it is not production-ready (i.e. Ruby, Python) or where the language footprint is deliberately minimal (i.e. Rust). 

### PHP
[PHP](http://www.php.net/) 7.1.16 is installed by source.  
PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.

### Ruby
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) 2.6.1 is installed via [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).  
Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language, focused on simplicity and productivity. 

### Python
[Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7.1 is installed via homebrew.  
Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.  

### JavaScript
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 11.10.0 is installed by official OSX package.  
Node.js is based on the V8 JavaScript engine, optimized by Google and supporting most of the new language's features.   

### Dart
[Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) version 2.1.0 is installed via homebrew.  
Dart is a VM based, object-oriented, sound typed language using a C-style syntax that transcompiles optionally into JavaScript.

### Elixir
[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) 1.8.1 is installed via homebrew.  
Elixir is a purely functional language that runs on the [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) VM and is strongly influenced by the Ruby syntax.

### Java
[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) JDK 10.0.1 is installed by official OSX package.  
Java is a VM based, statically typed, general-purpose language that is thread safe, object-oriented and, from version 8, supports functional paradigms.

### C-sharp
[C-sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) (C#) 7.0 language is part of the [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) 2.2.104 framework.  
C# is a VM based, statically typed, thread safe, object-oriented language.

### Crystal
[Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/) 0.27.2 is installed via homebrew.  
Crystal has a syntax very close to Ruby, but brings some desirable features such as statically typing and ahead of time (AOT) compilation.  

### Nim
[Nim](http://nim-lang.org/) 0.19.4 is installed via homebrew.  
Nim is an AOT, Python inspired, statically typed language that comes with an ambitious compiler aimed to produce code in C, C++, JavaScript or ObjectiveC.

### GO
[GO](https://golang.org/) language version 1.11.5 is installed by official OSX package.  
GO is an AOT language that focuses on simplicity and offers a broad standard library with [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) constructs built in.

### Rust
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language version 1.32.0 is installed by official package.  
Rust is an AOT, garbage collector free programming language, preventing segfaults and granting thread safety.

## Tools

### Wrk
I used [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) as the loading tool.  
I measured each application server six times, picking the best lap (but for VM based languages demanding longer warm-up).  
```shell
wrk -t 4 -c 100 -d30s --timeout 2000 http://0.0.0.0:9292
```

### Platform
These benchmarks are recorded on a MacBook PRO 15 mid 2015 having these specs:
* macOS High Sierra
* 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 (4 cores)
* 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3

### RAM and CPU
I measured RAM and CPU consumption by using macOS Activity Monitor dashboard and recording max consumption peak.  
For the languages relying on pre-forking parallelism i reported the average consumption by taking a snapshot during the stress period.

## Benchmarks
